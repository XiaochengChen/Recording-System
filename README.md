# Recording-System
A Java project I created from September, 2016 to December, 2016
Went through the complete System Development Life Cycle and used object-oriented programming 
Used Java to create records for every grocery and stored them in a hash table for high efficiency 
Developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface by Java Swing that increases usability
Designed Boolean functions to handle exceptions to increase systemâ€™s fault tolerance
Write and read information in data files to permanently store valuable info and prevent data loss
